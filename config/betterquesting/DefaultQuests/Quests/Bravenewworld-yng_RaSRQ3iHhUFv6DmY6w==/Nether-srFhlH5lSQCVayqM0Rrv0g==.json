Infernal coal will release CO when broken so you need a gas mask with a catalytic filter to harvest it without being hurt. Phosphorous ore should be harvested with silk touch to maximise yield and avoid getting white phosporous in your inventory. White phosphorous will burn you unless you have a fire suit or put it into your backpack."
