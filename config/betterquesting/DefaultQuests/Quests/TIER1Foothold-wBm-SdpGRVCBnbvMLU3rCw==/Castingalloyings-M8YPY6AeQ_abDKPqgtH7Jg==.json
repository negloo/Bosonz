You\u0027d be better off reading the wiki then following this quest but at the moment I am writing this the wiki is down due to DDOS attacks and players might not have internet so a backup might be useful. \n\nWhen using an alloying recipe the fluids will output from the red side and when not using a recipe they will output from the green side. These two tanks are separate.\n\nthese fluids will auto-output when there is an appropriate target under the output faucet. The most useful target to put under these faucet are foundry channels as these allow making a fluid distribution network wich will improve your foundry efficiency greatly. After conecting some foundry channels together you can put a shallow foundry bassin besides one of them. This will connect it to the channel and allow for it to fill up once you put an appropriate cast inside of it. To use the normal foundry bassin and to go down y levels you can use the foundry outlet. These will act like the faucet on the crucible when connected to a foundry channel or foundry tank and allow fluids to drop into other channels or a bassin with a mold. you can put hoppers under bassins to get their output automatically.\n\nSee the advanced tips tab for foundry efficiency tips and griefing with the foundry."
